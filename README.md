## 🚀 About the Project  
This project is a **simple browser-based game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allowed me to dive deeper into **JavaScript for handling game logic and interactivity**, while sharpening my **front-end development skills** with HTML and CSS.  

Even though it’s a small game, the process helped me:  
- Strengthen my understanding of **core web development concepts**  
- Practice **DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management**  
- Improve my skills in **responsive design** and clean UI  

I’m excited to keep learning by building more challenging projects! 🚀
