# 🚀 About the Project

This is a browser-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It helped me explore JavaScript logic, event handling, and interactive UI design while creating a fun and simple game.

By building this project, I improved my ability to:

Implement game logic and randomization in JavaScript

Handle DOM manipulation and event listeners for interactive gameplay

Build a responsive UI that works on both desktop and mobile

Maintain a clean and readable codebase
